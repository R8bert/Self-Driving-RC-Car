Personal Project: Self-Driving RC Car with 3D Printing and Modeling

Designed and built a self-driving RC car using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino
Utilized 3D modeling software to design the car's body and other components
3D printed the car's body and other components using a desktop 3D printer
Programmed the car to navigate autonomously using computer vision and machine learning techniques
Implemented various sensors and actuators to control the car's movement and avoid obstacles
Developed a user interface to remotely control the car through a web browser
Demonstrated the project at a local maker fair and received positive feedback from attendees
